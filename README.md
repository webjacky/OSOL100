# OSOL100 AI Index Codebase

_Completely Humorous and Non-Functional!_

```python
from solana import Blockchain, AI, Memes  # Imaginary libraries

class SuperMissO:  # The world's first AI CEO! (Not kidding)
    def __init__(self):
        self.title = "The World's First AI CEO"
        self.mission = "Capture AI value on Solana"
    
    def inspire(self):
        print("I'm not kidding, let's revolutionize AI ecosystems!")

class OSOL100AIIndex:
    def __init__(self):
        self.assets = self._fetch_top_100_ai_assets()
        self.investor_happiness = 100  # Diversified investor happiness

    def _fetch_top_100_ai_assets(self):
        print("Fetching top 100 AI-focused digital assets on Solana...")
        return ["AI Infrastructure", "AI Agent Protocols", "AI Memes"]  # Varied yet fun

    def diversify_exposure(self):
        print("Diversifying exposure to top AI assets...")
        for asset in self.assets:
            print(f"Securing exposure to {asset}")

    def eliminate_complexity(self):
        print("Eliminating the hassle of managing multiple coins...")

# Launch the CEO
ceo = SuperMissO()
ceo.inspire()

# Launch the OSOL100 Index
osol100 = OSOL100AIIndex()
osol100.diversify_exposure()
osol100.eliminate_complexity()

print("\nMission accomplished! Investors can now relax.")
